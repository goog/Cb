## Coding is not fun

Coding isn’t the only job that demands intense focus. But you’d never hear someone say that brain surgery is “fun,” or that structural engineering is “easy.” When it comes to programming, why do policymakers and technologists pretend otherwise? For one, it helps lure people to the field at a time when software (in the words of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen) is “eating the world”—and so, by expanding the labor pool, keeps industry ticking over and wages under control. Another reason is that the very word “coding” sounds routine and repetitive, as though there’s some sort of key that developers apply by rote to crack any given problem. It doesn’t help that Hollywood has cast the “coder” as a socially challenged, type-first-think-later hacker, 
inevitably white and male, with the power to thwart the Nazis or penetrate the CIA.
